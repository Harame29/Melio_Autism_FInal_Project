Melio Autism Prevalence Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes autism prevalence data to understand how reported autism rates have changed over time and how they differ across U.S. states. The dataset spans from 2000 to 2022, allowing for long-term trend analysis. The project follows the full data analytics process, including data loading, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and presentation.
