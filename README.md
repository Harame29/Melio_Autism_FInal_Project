# Melio_Autism_FInal_Project
This repository contains my final project for Data Science Programming. The project analyzes autism prevalence data from 2000 to 2022, including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualizations, and a final presentation of key findings.
# Autism Prevalence Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes autism prevalence data to understand how reported autism rates have changed over time and how they differ across U.S. states. The analysis follows the full data analytics process, including reading the raw dataset, cleaning the data, performing analysis, and presenting results using visualizations.

The dataset covers the years 2000 to 2022, allowing for long-term trend analysis.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to explore patterns in autism prevalence and highlight differences across years and states. These insights can help support public health planning, education, and healthcare decision-making.
